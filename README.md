Journal Six is Computer Aided Design (CAD) software for the PASSAP E6000 Knitting Machine. It is Windows software and will run on Windows XP or better, including Windows 10.  The software is now being distributed on a freeware basis.
The Journal Six installation program will install the following items on your computer:

1.	Extract (unzip) all the files in the zip file to a folder of your choosing, which will be referred to as the “install folder” in these instructions.
